**Instructions**: For the NBAfile.py program, for each line, create a string using string formatting that puts the
team, attendance, and ticket prices into a formatted string. Each line should look something like:
‘The attendance at Atlanta was 13993 and the ticket price was $20.06’
Your program should then print these strings instead of the lines. Submit your code and the
output of your program.
